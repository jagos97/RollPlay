## Logging in
When you press play, the first page you will see will be the login page. All you only need to enter nonempty strings in the boxes, and you should be good to go. There will be error messages if you leave them empty. You can also choose to sign up by pressing the link at the bottom. Again, just putting nonempty values should be good, but you need to make sure the passwords match or you will get another error.

## Chatting
Now let's say you want to have a normal chat with one of your friends on the app. There are many ways to chat, along with different types of chat. You can open your party chat in the parties page or talk to one of your friends in the friends page. There is also a lot of chat options in the chat menu at the bottom. Let's try the most interactive one we have though.

2. Click on `Other Chats` at the top
3. Click on the second chat there with `Dragon's Bane`
4. Tell him about your hesitation to kill Thorin.

7. Press `F2`
8. You are well prepared so make sure `Dragon's Bane` knows that.
9. Press `F3`
10. Give him some closing remarks.

There are a few other things you can do. Explore and have fun. Check out some of your parties and add people to them maybe even create another party or delete them all. Check out what characters you have, create one then delete them, you choose. Same thing with your friends. Because why not add some and then delete them all anyways. Try updating your availability and see what the other side of the scheduling works. Not everything is implemented but there are still a few things you can try out. You can also check out the notifications. You can clear them and see where they link to and the interactions they have. Enjoy.
